# The Game
This game was made for my final assignment in University of Helsinki's open online MOOC course: Advanced Course in Programming Python 2021.

The game's goal is to collect coins and avoid monsters. You can end your run and save high score by touching the door. Coins are worth one point per coin, if you touch the monster you lose 10 points. The Game ends if you touch the monster while having negative score.
